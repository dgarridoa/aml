# Kalman filter to solve solving a Linear Dynamical System

The **Kalman_Filter.ipynb** introduce state space model (SSM) and a special case known as linear dynamical system (LDS) where al CPDs are linear-Gaussians. Also we present de Kalman filtering algorithm to solve a generic LDS. Finally we show an example of an application to tracking a 2D object. The  **Kalman_Filter.pdf** file contains a summary of the above file.
