# Dirichlet Process

The **Dirichlet_Process.ipynb** has the definition of a Dirichlet Process(DP) and a basic implementation to sample from this process for the particular case where the base measure is Gaussian. The **Dirichlet_Process.pdf** file contains a summary of the above file.

See the notebook in this <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dgarridoa/dirichlet_process/blob/master/Dirichlet_Process.ipynb">link</a> for better rendering.
